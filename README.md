# Mind-uploading

This project aims to achieving mind-uploading by creating a digital copy of an individual human through the use of large language models and personal data such as emails, text messages, and diary entries. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, personality modeling algorithms, and interactive interfaces, we aim to develop a chatbot that mirrors the target's personality and memories. This is enabled by the revolution of artificial neural networks, specifically Large Language Models like OpenAI's ChatGPT, as well as the magic of the Internet.
